      <p style="font-size: 16px;">Suite is defined as a set of rooms designated for one person's or family's use or for a particular purpose. However, in music, the term Suite refers to a group of self-contained instrumental movements of varying character, usually in the same key.
        Just like a music suite, Practice Teaching is a movement of different experiences where each day has its own character, feelings and events to encounter. 
        This page is to present the viewers and readers of my personal journey as a Practice Teacher in Manila Science High School.

          <h2>Weekly Journal</h2>
          <p>
            It wasn't a perfect experience, yet it was remarkable. I learned that in the real world, teaching is stressful and filled with unexpected circumstances. However, it was still enjoyable because the students at Manila Science High School are very sweet and nice. I am thankful to all my co-PTs, CTs under the MAPEH Department, especially to Sir Alfie Abella, and the students for this milestone I've achieved. If there's one thing I can take from this experience, it's to be more passionate about teaching because the students are passionate about learning.

              <p>We were trained to explore the beneficial use of Virtual Reality in Teaching. As we continue to advance technologically, teachers must also be technologically literate by maximizing the use of current technologies that can enhance learning and teaching experiences. During the training, ample time was given to us to explore VR, and afterwards, we were asked about our insights. It's important to remember that while advanced technologies are good to use, we should also be aware of their limitations</p>
              <p>On January 25-26, PATNURO 2024 was held for Practice Teachers who are ready to be deployed. Here, we were provided with the rules we should abide by, as well as the requirements we need to meet after deployment. Additionally, tips were given to us to be more effective as pre-service teachers to our students.</p>
